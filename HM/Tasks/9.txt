Comparing best values (8,10,50,100 elements):
S[]SA-i=[-10,38,2,-19]
S[]TS-i=[7,-4,-20,-1]
S[]NS-i=[5,3,0,0]
S[]B-i=[0,0]

Results for tabu search seem to be better than simmulated annealing taking the best solution for all parameter combinations used.
Both simmulated annealing and tabu search seem to have resulted in worse reuslts than neighborhood search or backtracking
