Simulated annealing and tabu search are almost a must when solving a problem with a large solution space, the execution time is small, 
but the solutions have a high degree of difference to the global optimum, but the algorithms could be run more times, 
using neighborhood or backtracking being almost impossible from a practical standpoint. In some cases achieving the global optimum is not necessary.

Neighborhood search could be used for medium size solution spaces where execution time still is not impractically large.

Backtracking could be used for small solution spaces, always giving the global optimum.
